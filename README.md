### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learnt how to make good use of @media screen size i normally used to struggle with it but thanks to this
challenge things are different now.

Through this project i gained knowledge on how to structure a div with contents inside.

Highlighting my codes with comments was so fun.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development
I will love to learn more about CSS Flex Box and Grid, heared about CSS3 i will look more into it.

Currently learning Javascript hoping the best for the future.
